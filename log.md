# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, 6th May, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck into my Javascript course again, focused on working with Integers and learning Discrete Math (modulo/remainder operator)

**Thoughts:** I pushed through the boring parts and it's actually payed off big time with my learning process. Man, section 9, the Data Structures and Javascript Behind The Scenes, callstacks, heaps, Primitives; none of it really made sense at the time when I watched it months ago, but now, having watched it again recently-and having pushed forward with the coursework despite feeling like a dickhead-I can finally contextualise it, and abstract it in my head which helps SO much with both writing code in general, as well as re-factoring my code to clean it up.

He's got us working on this Bank app at the moment, it's 11:54pm and I just got home from a 2.5hr gym session consisting of BOTH chest & shoulders so I am _rooted_. I'll link all the work.....when I upload it tomorrow after getting my beauty sleep. And maybe an update of what's been going on since I last sat down to really code (_christmas, btw.._) because MAN life's been hectic. I wonder if people really read these things anyway, lol.

### Day 2: Tuesday, 7th May, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Today I did some more work on my Banking app, working specifically with more dates, times, and integers, as well as how to both manipulate the data, and transform said data into whatever I need it to be. Also went back into my Javascript Data Structures & Theory lectures.

**Thoughts:** Today was mainly spent just mucking around with the new Date() method because I'm an idiot and sometimes don't understand on the first go through..or fifth. I worked on primarily getting the transaction list to be functional by means of having the transactions reflect an automatically calculated time/date (In the Commonwealth format: _DAY, MONTH, YEAR_, sorrynotsorry Americans) and to also have those same dates/times/etc reflect upon other accounts' transaction history, like say if I wanted to take a loan, I can now hit the button and not only have that transaction reflect instantly, but also have it reflect, again, on other accounts, but this was only using template literals which is a bit...messy. I'll refactor it again tomorrow, and see how I go; my brain is fried again from doing this shit for hours straight.
