# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, 6th May, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck into my Javascript course again, focused on working with Integers and learning Discrete Math (modulo/remainder operator)

**Thoughts:** I pushed through the boring parts and it's actually payed off big time with my learning process. Man, section 9, the Data Structures and Javascript Behind The Scenes, callstacks, heaps, Primitives; none of it really made sense at the time when I watched it months ago, but now, having watched it again recently-and having pushed forward with the coursework despite feeling like a dickhead-I can finally contextualise it, and abstract it in my head which helps SO much with both writing code in general, as well as re-factoring my code to clean it up.

He's got us working on this Bank app at the moment, it's 11:54pm and I just got home from a 2.5hr gym session consisting of BOTH chest & shoulders so I am _rooted_. I'll link all the work.....when I upload it tomorrow after getting my beauty sleep. And maybe an update of what's been going on since I last sat down to really code (_christmas, btw.._) because MAN life's been hectic. I wonder if people really read these things anyway, lol.

**Link to work:** _on da wae_
